# Project 1 - *Flixter Movies*

**Flixter Movies** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
    * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
    * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [x] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [ ] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

## Notes

The process was very straight forward. I believe the hardest aspect of this project was the time I reserved for completing it.
I achieved a Minimum Viable Product in the desired time. However, I didn't allocate my time correctly so I could complete any of the stretch goals before submission.
